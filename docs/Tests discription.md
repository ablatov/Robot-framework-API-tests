# Test project description

## Tests structure
Testing framework -> Robot framework '''http://robotframework.org/'''

### Test resources
1. 'keywords' dir -> like 'programming methods' written on DSL language which makes some work.
2. 'variables.robot' -> Global test variables for all tests + all keywords included.
(in order to use only "variables.robot" file as a source for all test suites)
